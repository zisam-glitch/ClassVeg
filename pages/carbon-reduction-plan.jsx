            <strong>Baseline Emissions Footprint</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Baseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have
            been produced in the past and were produced prior to the
            introduction of any strategies to reduce emissions. Baseline
            emissions are the reference point against which emissions reduction
            can be measured.

          <p>
            <strong>Historic Deviations:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In our historical baseline data, there were certain deviations from
            the current requirements. Notably, our past reports did not
            encompass Scope 3 emissions. The omission of Scope 3 emissions from
            our previous reports was due to the lack of comprehensive data
            collection mechanisms for indirect emissions sources, such as
            employee commuting and business travel. Recognizing the increasing
            importance of capturing the full spectrum of our carbon footprint,
            we have now incorporated Scope 3 emissions into our reporting
            framework.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No Previous Reporting:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For many years, our organization operated without a formal
            greenhouse gas emissions assessment or reporting structure. This gap
            was primarily due to a lack of internal expertise and resources
            dedicated to environmental sustainability. However, with the growing
            global emphasis on climate action and our own commitment to
            corporate responsibility, we initiated a comprehensive emissions
            audit in 2020. This year now serves as our baseline, providing a
            clear picture of our emissions footprint and allowing us to set
            informed reduction targets.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Organizational Changes:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, our organization underwent significant restructuring,
            including the acquisition of a new subsidiary and the divestment of
            certain non-core operations. This substantial change in our
            operational landscape necessitated a re-evaluation of our emissions
            baseline. While our 2020 data provides valuable insights, the
            organizational changes mean that some of the emissions sources from
            that year are no longer relevant, while new sources have been
            introduced. As a result, we are in the process of establishing a new
            baseline that accurately reflects our current organizational
            structure and operations.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Moving Forward:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to continuous improvement in our emissions
            reporting and reduction efforts. Our team is actively exploring
            advanced data collection tools, engaging with sustainability
            consultants, and fostering a company-wide culture of environmental
            responsibility. We believe that with a clear understanding of our
            baseline emissions and the factors influencing them, we can make
            meaningful strides towards a more sustainable future.
