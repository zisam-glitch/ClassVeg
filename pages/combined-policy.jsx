          <summary>Alternative Packaging to Single-Use Plastics</summary>
          <p>
            We are acutely aware of the environmental impact of single-use
            plastics and are committed to sustainable practices. As such, we
            have explored and implemented several packaging alternatives:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Compostable Packaging:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or sugarcane.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Breaks down in a composting environment, leaving no toxic
                  residues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Biodegradable Plastics:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unlike conventional plastics, these are designed to degrade
                  over time when exposed to natural elements.
                </li>
                <li>Suitable for products with a shorter shelf life.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paper and Cardboard Packaging:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Sourced from sustainably managed forests.</li>
                <li>Widely recyclable and biodegradable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Glass Containers:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Reusable and recyclable.</li>
                <li>
                  Ideal for certain products due to its non-reactive nature.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloth or Fabric Pouches:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Made from natural fibers like cotton or jute.</li>
                <li>Reusable and eventually biodegradable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bamboo Packaging:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Bamboo grows rapidly and is a renewable resource.</li>
                <li>Biodegradable and has natural antimicrobial properties.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bulk Bins and Refill Stations:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For certain products, we can provide them in bulk bins,
                  allowing schools or institutions to refill their own reusable
                  containers.
                </li>
                <li>Reduces the need for individual packaging altogether.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Returnable Packaging Systems:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Containers can be returned, sanitized, and reused.</li>
                <li>Reduces the overall need for new packaging materials.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            We continuously research and test new sustainable packaging
            alternatives as they become available in the market. Our goal is to
            minimize our environmental footprint while ensuring the safety,
            freshness, and quality of the products we supply. We are also open
            to collaborating with clients to explore specific packaging
            solutions that align with their sustainability goals.

              Our operational model is designed to be both efficient and
              flexible, allowing us to address both planned and unplanned
              requirements with minimal delay.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Immediate Needs (0-24 hours):</strong> For urgent
                requirements, we can mobilize resources from our nearest depot.
                Depending on the volume of the request and the proximity of the
                delivery location, we can typically fulfil immediate needs
                within a 24-hour window.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short-Term Needs (24-72 hours):</strong> For requests
                that are not immediate but still require a quick turnaround, we
                can allocate resources from our network of depots and vehicle
                fleet to ensure delivery within a 24 to 72-hour timeframe.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Specialized Requests (3-7 days):</strong> For requests
                that might require specialized handling, sourcing, or additional
                resources, our lead time is typically between 3 to 7 days. This
                includes scenarios where we might need to source specific
                products or allocate specialized vehicles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
              It's worth noting that our lead times are influenced by several
              factors, including the volume of the request, the specific
              products or services required, current operational commitments,
              and external factors such as weather or transportation
              disruptions. However, we pride ourselves on our ability to adapt
              and respond to challenges, ensuring that our clients' needs are
              met promptly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
              In the event of an unplanned request, we recommend reaching out to
              our dedicated customer service team, who can provide a more
              accurate estimate based on the specifics of the requirement.

            <strong>Baseline Emissions Footprint</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Baseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have
            been produced in the past and were produced prior to the
            introduction of any strategies to reduce emissions. Baseline
            emissions are the reference point against which emissions reduction
            can be measured.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Historic Deviations:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In our historical baseline data, there were certain deviations from
            the current requirements. Notably, our past reports did not
            encompass Scope 3 emissions. The omission of Scope 3 emissions from
            our previous reports was due to the lack of comprehensive data
            collection mechanisms for indirect emissions sources, such as
            employee commuting and business travel. Recognizing the increasing
            importance of capturing the full spectrum of our carbon footprint,
            we have now incorporated Scope 3 emissions into our reporting
            framework.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No Previous Reporting:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For many years, our organization operated without a formal
            greenhouse gas emissions assessment or reporting structure. This gap
            was primarily due to a lack of internal expertise and resources
            dedicated to environmental sustainability. However, with the growing
            global emphasis on climate action and our own commitment to
            corporate responsibility, we initiated a comprehensive emissions
            audit in 2020. This year now serves as our baseline, providing a
            clear picture of our emissions footprint and allowing us to set
            informed reduction targets.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Organizational Changes:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, our organization underwent significant restructuring,
            including the acquisition of a new subsidiary and the divestment of
            certain non-core operations. This substantial change in our
            operational landscape necessitated a re-evaluation of our emissions
            baseline. While our 2020 data provides valuable insights, the
            organizational changes mean that some of the emissions sources from
            that year are no longer relevant, while new sources have been
            introduced. As a result, we are in the process of establishing a new
            baseline that accurately reflects our current organizational
            structure and operations.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Moving Forward:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to continuous improvement in our emissions
            reporting and reduction efforts. Our team is actively exploring
            advanced data collection tools, engaging with sustainability
            consultants, and fostering a company-wide culture of environmental
            responsibility. We believe that with a clear understanding of our
            baseline emissions and the factors influencing them, we can make
            meaningful strides towards a more sustainable future.
